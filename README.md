# HSA_Minecraft
A 3D Minecraft clone and engine, made in Ready to Program Java "IDE".

Requires HSA.Console() to work. If you're using Ready to Program ~~stop~~ just paste in the contents of `Minecraft.java`. Otherwise you're going to have to also copy-paste the source files for HSA and Ready from `Ready To Program\Support\Ready Classes` into your project, and configure your build path to include the `tools.jar` also included in the `Ready Classes` folder.
